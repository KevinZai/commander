## How tool references work

Plugin files use `~~category` as a placeholder for whatever tool the user connects in that category. For example, `~~project tracker` might mean Linear, Jira, or any other project tracker with an MCP server.

Plugins are **tool-agnostic** — they describe workflows in terms of categories rather than specific products. The `.mcp.json` pre-configures specific MCP servers, but any MCP server in that category works.

## Connectors for this plugin

**Bundled (2)** — work immediately, zero configuration, no API keys:
- `context7` — library documentation lookup
- `sequential-thinking` — structured multi-step reasoning

All other connectors below are **opt-in** via `/ccc-connect` — enable with your own credentials. This prevents silent MCP failures on install day (flagged by R1/R5/R8 reviews).

| Monitoring | `~~monitoring` | — | Datadog, New Relic, Grafana |
| Web search | `~~web search` | Tavily | Brave Search, SerpAPI |
| Library docs | `~~library docs` | Context7 (bundled) | — |
| Files | `~~files` | Google Drive | Dropbox, OneDrive |

## 📁 Perforce workspaces

If your repo is under Perforce control (P4V), set `CLAUDE_CODE_PERFORCE_MODE=1` in your shell env. Sub-agents will emit P4-friendly edit hints before writing files. Without this, writes will fail on read-only checked-in files. This is a Claude Code v2.1.98+ feature — transparent to CC Commander skills.
