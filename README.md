## Why CCC

Stock Claude Code is a blank terminal with amnesia. No skills. No guidance. No memory. Every session starts from zero. And it wastes 98% of your context window on tool output you'll never re-read.

**CCC remembers everything, learns from every session, and gets smarter the more you use it.** It wraps every major Claude Code tool into one install — with a smart orchestrator, guided menus, and an Intelligence Layer that auto-adjusts every dispatch based on your project.

```
You type: ccc
You get:  A guided AI project manager with 455+ skills,
          15 plugin skills, 5 agents, 20 vendor packages,
          real learning, and zero setup.
```

## Intelligence Layer

> Stock Claude Code is a blank terminal with amnesia. CCC remembers everything, learns from every session, and gets smarter the more you use it.

**An AI project manager that thinks before it acts.** Before dispatching a single token, CCC scores your task, reads your stack, pulls relevant lessons from past sessions, and selects the right model and budget automatically. No configuration. No flags. It just works.

### How It Works

**Four modules. Always running.**

#### 1. Weighted Complexity Scoring (`dispatcher.js`)

Every task scored 0–100 using 47 keyword signals, word count, and fuzzy regex matching:

```
"fix typo"             → score  0  → 10 turns, $1 budget, Haiku
"add dark mode"        → score 25  → 20 turns, $3 budget, Sonnet
"refactor auth module" → score 60  → 35 turns, $6 budget, Sonnet
"build SaaS platform"  → score 100 → 50 turns, $10 budget, Opus
```

File scope estimation adds 0–20 bonus points by scanning how many project files the task is likely to touch. Budget and turns auto-adjust — no manual flags needed.

#### 2. Stack Detection (`project-importer.js`)

CCC reads your project before every dispatch: `package.json`, `Dockerfile`, `go.mod`, `requirements.txt`. Detects nextjs, react, vue, docker, python, rust, go, github-actions, orm, billing, testing. Reads current git branch + last 5 commit themes. Adds monorepo detection (workspaces, lerna, turbo, nx).

#### 3. Skill Recommendations (`skill-browser.js`)

`recommendSkills(task, techStack)` combines three signals:

| Signal | Weight | What It Does |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Stack match | 10 pts | Next.js project → nextjs-app-router ranks first |
| Keyword match | 2 pts/hit | "auth" task → auth, jwt, better-auth bubble up |
| Usage history | boost | Skills that worked for you rank higher over time |

Trending skills (7-day window) surface automatically. Skills that led to successful sessions compound their ranking advantage.

#### 4. Knowledge Compounding (`knowledge.js`)

Every completed session extracts a lesson (keywords, category, stack, error patterns, success patterns) stored in `~/.claude/commander/`. Searched before the next dispatch with time-decay relevance: < 7 days = 2x, < 30 days = 1.5x, older = 1x. Fuzzy keyword matching and cross-domain boosts (web↔react, api↔backend, testing↔bugfix) catch related concepts.

**Smart retry** handles failures automatically: rate limit → wait 60s + retry; context overflow → reduce turns to 60% + retry; budget exceeded → clear error with next steps.

### Intelligence Analysis — Smart Dispatch in Action

Before dispatching a single token, CCC scores your task, reads your stack, and auto-configures the session.

```
  Task: "Add authentication with JWT and OAuth"

  Intelligence Analysis:
  ├─ Complexity Score: 72/100 (complex)
  ├─ Keyword signals:  +15 (auth) +15 (implement) +20 (production)
  ├─ Word count:       +10 (detailed description)
  ├─ Stack detected:   nextjs, react, tailwind
  └─ Related lessons:  2 found (JWT auth succeeded, OAuth2 pattern)

  Auto-configured dispatch:
     Model: opus  |  Turns: 35  |  Budget: $6
     Skills: nextjs-app-router, ccc-saas, auth-patterns
     Knowledge: 2 past lessons injected

  Dispatching... ████████████████████░░░░ 78%
```

### Skill Recommendations — Ranked by Relevance

CCC ranks skills using your stack + task keywords + past usage. The right tools surface automatically.

```
  Recommended skills for your project:

  SCORE  SKILL                 WHY
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────
   20    nextjs-app-router     Stack match + keyword
   16    frontend-design       Stack match
   16    shadcn-ui             Stack match
   14    saas-scaffolder       Keyword: auth, billing
   12    tailwind-v4           Stack match
    8    ccc-testing           Always recommended

  ❯ Use top recommendation
    Browse all 455+ skills
    Search by keyword
    Back to main menu
```

### Knowledge Compounding — Learning After Every Session

Every completed session extracts patterns and errors. The next dispatch is informed by everything that worked before.

```
  Session Complete — Knowledge Extracted

  Task:     "Add JWT authentication"
  Outcome:  Success
  Cost:     $4.12  |  Duration: 12m
  Category: api

  Patterns learned:
  ├─ bcrypt + JWT combo works well with Next.js
  ├─ httpOnly cookies for token storage
  ├─ middleware.ts matcher needs exact paths
  └─ next-auth conflicts with custom Prisma adapter

  Knowledge base: 47 lessons  |  12 categories
  Next dispatch will be 23% more informed.
```

### Project Import — Stack Auto-Detection

CCC reads your project before every dispatch. No setup needed.

```
  Importing: ~/projects/my-saas-app

  Detected:
  ├─ CLAUDE.md           142 lines
  ├─ Tech stack:         nextjs, react, tailwind, prisma, stripe
  ├─ Monorepo:           No
  ├─ Git branch:         feature/checkout
  └─ Recent commits:     "add cart", "fix price calc", "stripe webhook"

  6 skills pre-selected for this stack
  3 relevant lessons from knowledge base

  ❯ Start building in this project
    Run /xray health audit first
    Back to main menu
```

### The Net Effect

| Session | What Changed |
|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Dispatches based on complexity score alone |
| 5 | Knows your stack, recommends proven skills |
| 20 | Has learned your patterns — feels like a PM who knows your codebase |

### Token Optimization Stack — 5 Layers of Savings

| Layer | Tool | Savings |
|-------|------|---------|
| Tool output sandboxing | context-mode | **98%** — SQLite + FTS5, BM25 snippets only |
| CLI output filtering | RTK | 99.5% — strips verbose shell output |
| Skill tiering | `_tiers.json` | ~10k tokens — 30 essential vs 459 full |
| Rate limit rotation | ClaudeSwap | 2 MAX accounts, drain-first strategy |
| Prompt caching | Extended TTL | 90% discount, 1hr cache window |

<img src="docs/assets/section-install.svg" alt="Install" width="100%">

## Quick Start — Pick Your Path

One question: **How are you using Claude?**

### Path A: Desktop Plugin (Recommended)

> The primary way to use CCC. Works in Claude Desktop and any Claude Code session.

```
/plugin marketplace add KevinZai/commander
/plugin install commander
```

CCC appears as a plugin you can invoke immediately. Say "start ccc" or "what should I build" to begin.

**What you get:** 15 plugin skills, 5 specialized agents, 6 lifecycle hooks, 5 MCP servers — all with free/pro tier support.

**Marketplace:** `commander-marketplace` at [KevinZai/commander](https://github.com/KevinZai/commander)

---

### Path B: Claude Code (Slash Commands)

> You want skills + commands inside Claude Code sessions.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KevinZai/commander/main/install-remote.sh | bash
```

Then in any Claude Code session:

```
/ccc
```

Full interactive menu appears. Same features, no separate CLI needed.

**What you get:** All 455+ skills and commands, no extra CLI binary required.

---

### Your First 60 Seconds

```
1. ccc → Main menu (14 options)
2. Pick "Build something new" → Choose project type
3. Answer 3 multiple-choice questions → CCC generates a plan
4. CCC dispatches Claude with the right model, budget, and skills
5. Session ends → CCC extracts lessons → gets smarter next time
```

No configuration. No YAML. No API keys. The Intelligence Layer handles everything.

---

### CLI Installation (Legacy)

> You use `claude` in your terminal and prefer a standalone CLI.

**Option 1 — One-liner install:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KevinZai/commander/main/install-remote.sh | bash
```

**Option 2 — npm:**
```bash
npm install -g cc-commander
```

Then:
```bash
ccc
```

Arrow keys to navigate. Enter to select. That's it.

**Update anytime:**
```bash
ccc --update
```

**Where files live:**
- Source: `~/.cc-commander/` (auto-created by installer)
- Config: `~/.claude/` (skills, commands, hooks, CLAUDE.md)
- Binary: `ccc` → symlinked to source

> Don't delete `~/.cc-commander/` — the `ccc` command needs it.

**What you get:** Full CLI with tmux split mode, daemon, theme switching, and the cockpit dashboard.

---

## CLI Reference

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `ccc` | Interactive mode (default — tmux tabbed) |
| `ccc --stats` | Sessions, streaks, level, cost |
| `ccc --test` | 22-point self-test (verify install) |
| `ccc --update` | Pull latest + reinstall |
| `ccc --repair` | Reset corrupt state |
| `ccc --simple` | Menu-only, no tmux |
| `ccc --dispatch "task"` | Headless dispatch (for AI agents) |
| `ccc --skills` | Manage skill tiers (list, install, remove, tier) |

### Split Mode

**The default mode.** Tabbed tmux sessions. Each task gets its own window.

CCC menu runs in tab 0. Each dispatched task opens a new tmux window where Claude works with full output visible.

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Ctrl+A n` | Next tab |
| `Ctrl+A p` | Previous tab |
| `Ctrl+A 0` | Back to CCC menu |
| `Ctrl+A q` | Quit session |
| Mouse click | Switch tabs |

### Cancel Running Tasks

- **During any build:** Press `Escape` or `q` to kill the Claude process and return to menu
- **During YOLO loop:** `touch ~/.claude/commander/yolo-stop` to halt between cycles
- **In split mode:** Switch to the Claude tab and `Ctrl+C`

### Daemon Mode

**KAIROS-inspired persistent background agent.** Monitors your project, processes queued tasks, and consolidates knowledge — all hands-free.

```bash
ccc --daemon                    # Start (runs in background)
ccc --queue "fix login bug"     # Add task to queue
ccc --queue-list                # Show pending tasks
ccc --daemon-stop               # Stop daemon
```

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| Tick loop (5 min) | Checks queue, git status, dispatches work |
| Dream mode (1 hr) | Consolidates knowledge, detects error patterns |
| Task queue | Priority-based, file-backed, auto-dispatch |
| Budget cap | 15-second limit per tick action |

Customize: `--interval 120` (2 min ticks) · `--tick-budget 30` · `--dream 30` (30 min dreams)

---

## Use Inside Claude Code

No CLI needed. Type `/ccc` in any Claude Code session for the full interactive menu.

```
/ccc              → Main menu (15 options with sub-menus)
/ccc xray         → Project health scan
/ccc makeover     → Auto-apply top fixes
/ccc refresh      → Update your CLAUDE.md from latest template
/ccc domains      → Browse 11 CCC domains
/ccc skills       → Browse 455+ skills
/ccc grill        → 7-question Socratic planning probe
/ccc infra        → Infrastructure sub-menu (Fleet, Synapse, Cost, AO, CloudCLI, Paperclip)
/ccc detect       → Probe all services and CLIs
```

Same choices, same sub-menus, same actions as the full CLI. Cancel anytime with "back" or `Escape`. Also works in **Claude Desktop Cowork** and **VS Code / Cursor**.

## Agent-Friendly API

CCC is built to be controlled by AI agents — OpenClaw, Claude Code, or any orchestrator.

| Command | Output | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| `ccc --dispatch "task" --json` | JSON | Run task headlessly |
| `ccc --list-skills --json` | JSON | All 455+ skills |
| `ccc --list-sessions --json` | JSON | Session history |
| `ccc --status` | JSON | Health check |
| `ccc --template` | text | Latest CLAUDE.md template |

**Override flags:** `--model opus` · `--max-turns 50` · `--budget 5` · `--cwd /path`

```bash
# OpenClaw agent dispatches a build
result=$(ccc --dispatch "Build auth with JWT" --json --model opus --budget 5)

# Claude Code agent checks available skills
ccc --list-skills --json | jq '.[] | select(.name | contains("auth"))'
```

## Security

- **No command injection** — all shell calls use `execFileSync` with array arguments
- **Auto-mode by default** — dispatches use `--permission-mode auto`, not `--dangerously-skip-permissions`
- **YOLO only skips** — only YOLO/night mode uses skip-permissions (intentional, documented)
- **Zero npm vulnerabilities** — verified on every CI run
- **PII scanning** — CI blocks commits containing personal data patterns
- **Error containment** — every error returns to menu with error ID, never raw stack traces
- **Pre-publish checks** — `npm run prepublishOnly` runs all tests + lint before publish

## Agent Bible

**[BIBLE-AGENT.md](docs/BIBLE-AGENT.md)** — 268-line machine-readable reference. Any AI agent reads this and can manage CCC immediately.

```bash
# Tell any agent:
"Read docs/BIBLE-AGENT.md from the cc-commander repo, then use the CLI API to manage this project."
```

Covers: CLI API, dispatch patterns, JSON schemas, skill catalog, level/model defaults, integration points.

## The Kevin Z Method

> 7 rules from 200+ articles. 14 months of production.

1. Plan before coding
2. Context is milk — keep it fresh
3. Verify, don't trust
4. Subagents = fresh context
5. CLAUDE.md is an investment
6. Boring solutions win
7. Operationalize every fix

Full methodology: **[BIBLE.md](BIBLE.md)** — 2000+ lines, 7 chapters, appendices.

For AI agents: **[BIBLE-AGENT.md](docs/BIBLE-AGENT.md)** — 268-line machine-readable version.

## Who Built This

CCC is built by [Kevin Z](https://kevinz.ai) ([@kzic](https://x.com/kzic)) — a non-technical entrepreneur and CEO of [MyWiFi Networks](https://mywifinetworks.com) (20+ years in tech, never wrote production code). He wanted to leverage Claude Code to its max capabilities without chasing plugins, reading changelogs, or memorizing commands. So he scanned every Claude Code article, plugin, and skill on the internet — 200+ sources — and distilled it into one self-learning AI project manager. Every feature was built with Claude Code itself. If a non-coder can build a 450+ skill toolkit with AI, imagine what you can build.
