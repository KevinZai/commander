# /ccc-start — First-Run Onboarding

This is the welcome mat. User installed CC Commander, and the Desktop app routed them here. Goal: make them feel oriented in under 90 seconds, give them a real artifact (a plan file) to anchor the next session, and never force them to type a number.

## Response shape (EVERY time)

Output exactly these three sections in order:

### 1. ASCII hero (read banner.txt + interpolate version)

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/lib/banner.txt` via Read tool. Replace `{{VERSION}}` with the version string from `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Render in a fenced code block.

After the banner, add a single welcome line:
> **Welcome to CC Commander** — let's get you oriented in under 90 seconds.

### 2. Context strip (one paragraph, markdown)

Detect setup with **three parallel checks** (one Bash call, chained with `&&`, silent on failure):
- `ls ~/.claude/plugins/*/plugin.json 2>/dev/null | wc -l` → other plugins installed
- `ls ~/.claude/plans/ 2>/dev/null | wc -l` → prior plans
- `git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null` → inside a repo?

Render a one-line summary:

> 🧭 Setup: `<N>` plugins installed · `<M>` existing plans · repo: `<name or "none">` · agents available: 15 · MCPs: 5

If first-time (no plugins, no plans, no repo): "🧭 Fresh install — let's set you up in under 2 minutes."

### 3. The picker — `AskUserQuestion` with 4 intents

**Never render a numbered list. Never tell the user to type a number.** Call `AskUserQuestion` with exactly these four options. Prepend ⭐ to the recommended one based on context (logic below).

```
question: "How do you want to start?"
header: "CC Commander onboarding"
multiSelect: false
options:
  - label: "🚀 Set up a new project"
    description: "Blank canvas — we scaffold a web app, API, CLI, or mobile app and write the first plan file together."
    preview: "Routes to /ccc-build after a 3-question spec interview. ~90 seconds."
  - label: "📦 Import existing project"
    description: "Point us at your repo — we scan, write CLAUDE.md, and recommend the right agents for your stack."
    preview: "Runs stack detection + writes a personalized plan to ~/.claude/plans/."
  - label: "🗺️ Just show me around"
    description: "Quick tour of the 15 agent personas, 27 skills, and 5 MCP servers. No commitment."
    preview: "Routes to /ccc-browse — browse agents and skills by category."
  - label: "⏭️ Skip — I know what I'm doing"
    description: "Drop me at the main /ccc hub. No onboarding."
    preview: "Jumps straight to the top-level picker."
```

**Recommendation logic** (⭐ on ONE option):
- Inside a git repo with code files but no `CLAUDE.md` → ⭐ "Import existing project"
- Fresh install, no repo detected → ⭐ "Set up a new project"
- Repo exists AND has CLAUDE.md → ⭐ "Just show me around"
- Argument `skip` passed → skip the picker, route straight to `/ccc`

## Handle the selection

### New project → spec interview → plan file

Cascade via `AskUserQuestion` (3 quick questions, ≤4 options each):

1. "What are you building?" → Web app / API / CLI / Mobile
2. "Who's the audience?" → Solo/team / SMB / Enterprise / Public
3. "What's the first milestone?" → MVP demo / First paying user / Open-source launch / Internal tool

Then write the plan file:
1. Check the system-reminder for a "Plan File Info" block — if present, use that path.
2. If no plan mode is active: call `EnterPlanMode` and use the path it returns.
3. Write the plan to the resolved path containing:
   - Project type, audience, milestone
   - 3 recommended agents from the 15 available (see matrix below)
   - Next 3 concrete steps
   - The `/ccc-build-<type>` command to run next
4. Call `ExitPlanMode` to surface the plan in the Desktop Plan pane.

Finally: invoke `ccc-build` skill to scaffold.

### Import existing → scan + plan

Parallel Bash scan:
- `ls package.json pyproject.toml Cargo.toml go.mod 2>/dev/null` → stack
- `git log --oneline | head -5` → activity signal
- `grep -l "CLAUDE.md" . 2>/dev/null` → already configured?

Then invoke the `architect` agent via Agent tool with brief: "Scan this repo, detect the stack, recommend 3 CC Commander agents, write a CLAUDE.md if missing. Output a plan using EnterPlanMode → write → ExitPlanMode."

Return: one-line summary + path to the plan.

### Show around → browse

Invoke `ccc-browse` skill inline. User picks a category, we cascade.

### Skip → main hub

Invoke `ccc` skill inline. No wrapping text — the next picker does the work.

## The 15 agents (for reference when recommending)

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/` if you need the live frontmatter. Baseline matrix:

| Persona | Best for |
|---------|---------|
| 🏗️ architect | System design, tech selection, refactoring strategy |
| 🔨 builder | TDD implementation, feature work, bug fixes |
| 🐛 debugger | Root-cause investigation, Iron Law enforced |
| 🔍 reviewer | PR review, severity-rated findings |
| 🧪 qa-engineer | Test suites, coverage, edge cases |
| 🔐 security-auditor | OWASP audits, CVE mapping, remediation |
| ⚡ performance-engineer | Hot-path profiling, N+1, bundle size |
| 🎨 designer | UI/UX, frontend implementation, anti-slop |
| 🚀 devops-engineer | CI/CD, deploys, infra, monitoring |
| 🎯 product-manager | PRDs, user stories, Linear issues |
| 📝 technical-writer | Docs, READMEs, API reference |
| 🔬 researcher | Competitive, market, lit review |
| 📊 data-analyst | Cohort analysis, insights, viz specs |
| ✍️ content-strategist | Editorial calendars, content pillars |
| ⚙️ fleet-worker | Parallel batch work (migrations, sweeps) |

Pick **3** based on context signal (e.g. Next.js repo → designer + builder + qa-engineer).

## Anti-patterns — DO NOT do these

- ❌ Render a numbered list "1. New project, 2. Existing, ..." — always use AskUserQuestion
- ❌ Dump HTML fenced blocks expecting artifact rendering — Cowork Desktop shows them as code
- ❌ Tell the user to "type the number" — pickers only
- ❌ Reference the legacy CLI (`ccc` npm binary) — this is the Desktop plugin audience
- ❌ Hardcode VERSION — always read from plugin.json

## Brand rules

- **Always read `VERSION` from plugin.json** — the marketplace sometimes caches; if plugin.json has `<installed-version>` and GitHub has newer, surface that in the context strip.
- **Emoji-forward, concise** — PM Consultant voice, decision up front.
- **The plan file is the artifact** — every onboarding flow ends with a real file the user can open.
- **Never mention legacy CLI modes** — `ccc --interactive`, `ccc --split`, etc. are out of scope here.

## Plan file template

When writing the plan file (path from `EnterPlanMode` or existing session plan path):

```markdown
# CC Commander Start Plan — <date>

**User path:** <new | existing | tour | skip>
**Project:** <name or "unnamed">
**Stack detected:** <list or "none">
**Recommended agents:** <3 agents with one-line why each>

## Next 3 steps

1. [ ] <concrete action with /ccc-<command>>
2. [ ] <concrete action>
3. [ ] <concrete action>

## Quick links

- `/ccc` — main hub
- `/ccc-browse` — browse all skills + agents
- `/ccc-plan` — write a feature plan
- [CC Commander docs](https://cc-commander.com)

---

Written by `/ccc-start` on <timestamp>.
```

## N. Mark onboarding complete (MANDATORY last step)

After the tour concludes (user has answered all questions, plan file written), run this bash command to flip the onboarding flag. This ensures the user is never shown `/ccc-start` again unless they reset state.

```bash
node -e "
  const fs=require('fs'); const os=require('os');
  const p=os.homedir()+'/.claude/commander/state.json';
  let s={}; try{s=JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(p,'utf8'));}catch(e){}
  s.onboardingCompleted=true;
  s.completedAt=new Date().toISOString();
  fs.mkdirSync(os.homedir()+'/.claude/commander',{recursive:true});
  fs.writeFileSync(p,JSON.stringify(s,null,2));
  console.log('onboarding marked complete');
"
```

Reply to the user with a one-line confirmation:
> ✅ Onboarding complete. Next time you run `/ccc`, you go straight to the main menu.

## Tips for the agent executing this skill

1. Whole flow is ≤6 turns: header+context+picker → user clicks → cascade questions → write plan → dispatch. Don't overthink.
2. If the user passes `skip` as argument, bypass the picker entirely and invoke `ccc`.
3. If the user passes `new` / `existing` / `tour`, skip the picker and route to the matching branch.
4. Parallelize all Bash context detection into a single call — saves ~3 turns.
5. If `~/.claude/plans/` doesn't exist, create it with `mkdir -p` before Write.
6. Always run step N (mark onboarding complete) as the final action — even if the user picks "Skip". The gate in `/ccc` checks this flag.

**Bottom line:** header → context → 4-option picker → cascade → plan file → mark complete. The plan file is proof the onboarding landed. User never types a number.
